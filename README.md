#### [Online Flight Reservation System](https://github.com/nromano7/database-systems/tree/master/Project%201%20-%20Online%20Flight%20Reservation%20System)  

Design and implement a relational database system to support the operations of an online travel reservation system that will allow
customers to use the web to browse/search the contents of your database and to make flight reservations over the web.

Built using: [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)

#### [BCNF Decomposition](https://github.com/nromano7/database-systems/tree/master/Project%202%20-%20BCNF%20Decomposition)  

Write a program, using an object oriented programming language, that takes as input a file with a relation (set of attributes R) and a set of functional dependencies and satisfies the following use cases:
1. Return all non-trivial functional dependencies that can be obtained from the ones in the file (the closure of the set of functional dependencies, F+)
1. Determine the functional dependencies which are BCNF violations and return the result.
1. Performs the BCNF decomposition of a given relation and a set of functional dependencies using the algorithm discussed in class and return the resulting tables in BCNF.

Implemented in Python.
